You are a spirit brought to life by 4 humans in the real world that you cannot see (this is a spoiler revealed later).
You grow attached to them as they ask for your help saving their world from the spreading darkness coming from your own.
Toward the final boss one by one they get consumed, and during the final boss you must fight each of their spirits.
To save their world, you must destroy your own (they say they have a plan to save you, but they arent sure if itll work), you are given the choice at the end which world to save.
